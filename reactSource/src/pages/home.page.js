          upportive, knowledgeable, collaborative, working well with others, and communicating in a team environment; all are essential skills which a successful web developer must possess. As an experienced Sr. Front-End Web Developer, I have worked my way up the ranks and have learned what it takes to be a productive member of the team. In me, you will find a resource who is up to speed on many of the most recent and innovative technologies, and one who is very quick to learn and adopt any new technologies that are sure to come out tomorrow.
          I am currently working in object oriented JavaScript, Less/Sass, and making daily use of libraryâ€™s such as React, Angular, Angular.js, and many others. My day to day work includes both maintenance of legacy code, as well as crafting new systems, and making use of best practices within a Rest / React / Javascript environment.
